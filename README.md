# BEM_Solver (2D): a solver based on Boundary Element Method
In this repository, we aim to build a simple two-dimensional Boundary Element Method (BEM) solver to compute the velocity field of a wave system using given surface information: surface velocity potential $\phi^S(x)$ and surface elevation $\eta(x)$.

For details of the theory, please refer to the **theory** folder in this repository.

The governing equation for the 2D wave field (irrotational and incompressible) is the Laplace equation:

$$
\nabla^2 \phi = 0
$$
