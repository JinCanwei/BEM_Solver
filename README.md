# BEM_Solver (2D): a solver based on Boundary Element Method
In this repository, we try to build a simplel solver (two-dimensional) based on Boundary Element Method (BEM) to calculate the while velocity field with given surface information of a wave field (surface velocity potential ($\phi^S(x)$) and surface elevation ($\eta(x)$)). 


For some details of the thoery, please refer to "theory" folder in this repository. 

The governing equation for 2D wave field (irrotional and incompressible)
$$ \nabal \phi = 0$$
